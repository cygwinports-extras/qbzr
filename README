qbzr
------------------------------------------
A simple Qt cross-platform frontend for some of Bazaar commands

Purpose of this plugin is to provide a graphical user interface for 
those Bazaar commands where it can simplify the usage. Highlighting of 
differences between files, browsable log view, possibility to commit 
only some files without listing them all on the command line, etc.

On the other hand, it's not intended to be a full-featured application 
with GUI for all Bazaar operations.
